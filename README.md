# Weather-Spotifier (Svelte Version)

This is an alternative version of my [Weather-Spotifier](https://github.com/KCM78/weather-spotifier) app that uses `Svelte` rather than `Angular` for the frontend code. This was done really as an experiment to play with `Svelte`, but having done so, I much prefer this over the `Angular` version.


## How to Use

- `npm run server` to run the node server to authenticate with Spotify
- `npm run build` then `npm run start` to run the `Svelte` app
